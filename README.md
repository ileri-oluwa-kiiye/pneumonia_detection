# Pneumonia Detection for Chest X-rays

This project fine-tunes a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify pneumonia in chest X-ray images. It uses a combination of pediatric, adult, and COVID-19 pneumonia datasets to improve model generalization.

## Datasets
- Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray
- Chest X-ray COVID-19 Pneumonia
- Adult Chest X-ray Pneumonia

Datasets are automatically downloaded via the Kaggle API.

## Features
- Automated dataset download and extraction
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Fine-tuning of a pretrained ResNet
- Model training, evaluation with a 99.88% accuracy
